Onion.Factory
=============
This Onion.Factory sample is a very simple Domain Driven Design sample application which follows the onion architecture pattern. The sample is used to illustrate the difference between the onion architecture and the layered architecture pattern. The namespaces in this sample simulate rings.

The sample is very simple. The idea is that the domain model behind it represents a factory which produces onions (what a coincidence). In order to be able to create onion a factory responsible for creating onions must be created first.
